## 🌟 Introduction  
**SpoofShieldAI** is an **AI-driven framework** to detect **email spoofing, phishing, and homograph attacks** by analyzing **headers, domains, and advanced features** that even Gmail and Yahoo often miss.  

It extracts **key features** from `.eml` and `.mbox` files such as:  
- ✅ SPF / DKIM / DMARC authentication results  
- ✅ Return-Path & Sender domain mismatch detection  
- ✅ Homograph & IDN (Internationalized Domain Name) attacks  
- ✅ Number of Received headers  
- ✅ Message-ID domain analysis  
- ✅ URL and attachment-based phishing markers  
- ✅ AI-based classification for **spam vs ham**

## 🚀 Features  
- 🔍 **Header Analysis** → SPF, DKIM, DMARC validation  
- 🌐 **Homograph Attack Detection** → Detects visually similar (IDN) domains  
- 📂 **Multi-format Support** → Works with `.eml` and `.mbox` datasets  
- 📊 **ML-Powered Classification** → RandomForest/XGBoost models  
- 🎨 **GUI Application (Tkinter)** → Animated, user-friendly interface with loading screens  
- 📈 **Future Extensions** → Visual phishing detection, URL reputation analysis, enterprise dashboards
