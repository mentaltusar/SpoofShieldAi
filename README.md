## 🌟 Introduction  
**SpoofShieldAI** is an **AI-driven framework** to detect **email spoofing, phishing, and homograph attacks** by analyzing **headers, domains, and advanced features** that even Gmail and Yahoo often miss.

- ✅ SPF / DKIM / DMARC authentication results  
- ✅ Return-Path & Sender domain mismatch detection  
- ✅ Homograph & IDN (Internationalized Domain Name) attacks  
- ✅ Number of Received headers  
- ✅ Message-ID domain analysis  
- ✅ URL and attachment-based phishing markers  
- ✅ AI-based classification for **spam vs ham**
